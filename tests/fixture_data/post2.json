We aimed to investigate whether HIV-1 infection changed the anti-TB immune response in vivo in patients with active TB, by using the tuberculin skin test (the TST, also known as the Mantoux test) as a challenge model. By analysing biopsy samples taken from the site of TSTs, we found several effects of HIV-1. In early HIV-1 infection, we found diminishment of an immune response component that usually helps prevent harmful inflammation. In more advanced HIV-1, we found almost complete absence of any anti-TB immune response, except for activity which is normally part of our defence against viruses. In a third group of patients, in whom active TB only became apparent after starting treatment for HIV-1, we found that most immune responses had recovered to normal levels, but that one particular response sometimes associated with asthma and allergies was exaggerated.\r\n\r\nOur results provide new insights which may help explain why HIV-1 positive patients have a substantially increased risk of active TB, and which may inform the development of new treatments for HIV-1/TB co-infection.\r\n\r\nWe will be answering your questions about our research, TB and HIV at 1pm ET.
